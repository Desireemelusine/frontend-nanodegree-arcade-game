<h1>Welcome to "Sweet Crazy Ladybugs Game"</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
This game was developed based on the frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game project.
The purpose of the project is to work with <strong>Object-oriented</strong> (class functions or class prototype functions) and the correct use of "this".

The rest of the coding was developed by me <em>with the help and collaboration of my mentor, udacity forum frontend group and a lot of research based on developer.mozilla.org, w3schools.com and bootstrap.<em>
The Gems was an additional option that  I decided to do it to make it the game more fun and to practice more the Object-oriented.
